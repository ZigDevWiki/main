# Welcome

  📱 The main idea behind this mini-wiki is to make it easier and faster to get to know the gist  
  for beginners who want to learn how to make DIY Zigbee devices.

  🎁 We can help many others by collecting as much useful information as possible in one place.  

  ✅ If you have any useful information (link, article, source code, printed circuit board, etc.) that will be relevant,
  just make a PR to the main branch or issue to [this](https://github.com/ZigDevWiki/main) repository and it will be added.

  🙏 We would be grateful for any help from the community!

  🔵 Let's start from the [beginning](./Begin/)
